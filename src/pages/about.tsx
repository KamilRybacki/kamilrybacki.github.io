						<AboutMeSectionParagraph>
							**In short**, I am a software developer and organizational journal editor from **Gda≈Ñsk**.
						</AboutMeSectionParagraph>
						<AboutMeSectionParagraph>
							I **love** playing around with new technologies and **applying them** in my professional workflow
							and everyday life, which can be seen in **my projects**.
						</AboutMeSectionParagraph>
						<AboutMeSectionParagraph>
							Apart from **softdev**, my interests are **electronics**, **3d printing** and spending time together 
							with other people over **beer** and **horrendously complicated boardgames**.
						</AboutMeSectionParagraph>
					</Section>
					<Section title="What do I do?">
						<AboutMeSectionParagraph>
							**Profesionally**, I aim to provide solutions to problems encountered in **data mining** and **integration of external APIs/databases** with **user interfaces**.
						</AboutMeSectionParagraph>
					</Section>
					<Section title="What do I want?">
						<AboutMeSectionParagraph>
							**When it comes to this site**, I want to simply share my knowledge with others,
							while also having a **cool looking** portfolio to showcase my work.
						</AboutMeSectionParagraph>
						<AboutMeSectionParagraph>
							As for my **carrier path**, I want to specialize more into **DevOps** and **IaC**, while also improving my **data mining** expertise and knowledge about **integrating backend services** with **intuitive user interfaces** (both in terms of graphical UIs and easy-to-use APIs).
						</AboutMeSectionParagraph>
						<AboutMeSectionParagraph>
							Additionally, I am constantly working on my **design** skills to make the aforementioned interfaces **NOT** make my users gouge their eyes out.
							So **in short**, I want to eventually be a **Full-stack developer** with some **UI/UX skills under my belt**.
