                **In short**, I am a software developer
                 and organizational journal editor from **Gda≈Ñsk**.
            </AboutMeSectionParagraph>
            <AboutMeSectionParagraph>
                I **love** playing around with new technologies 
                and **applying them** in my professional workflow
                and everyday life, which can be seen in **my projects**.
            </AboutMeSectionParagraph>
            <AboutMeSectionParagraph>
                Apart from **softdev**, my interests are **electronics**, [**3d printing**](https://www.printables.com/pl/social/226178-kamil-rybacki) and spending time together with other people over **beer** and [**horrendously complicated boardgames**](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/Kokoszko).

            <AboutMeSectionParagraph>
                **In terms of my programming job**,
                I aim to provide solutions to problems encountered in
                **data mining** and **integration of external APIs/databases**
                with **user interfaces**.
            </AboutMeSectionParagraph>
            <AboutMeSectionParagraph>
                Currently, I am **mostly** doing **backend** tasks
                and my go-to language is **Python** due to a
                straightforward **integration with popular
                computation suites/platforms** (such as JupyterLab)
                and **custom APIs created with FastAPI and/or Celery**.
            </AboutMeSectionParagraph>
            <AboutMeSectionParagraph>
                On the other hand, I am also an **organizational editor** of [**TASK Quarterly**](https://journal.mostwiedzy.pl/TASKQuarterly) **IT scientific journal** i.e. I am responsible for **establishing collaborations with indexation databases**
                (e.g. [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/toc/1428-6394)) or other organizations and I am **overseeing integration of tools** such as [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) into our publishing workflow.

          <Section title="What do I want?">
            <AboutMeSectionParagraph>
                **When it comes to this site**,
                I want to simply share my knowledge with others,
                while also having a **cool looking**
                portfolio to showcase my work.
            </AboutMeSectionParagraph>
            <AboutMeSectionParagraph>
                As for my **carrier path**,
                I want to specialize more into **DevOps** and **IaC**,
                while also improving my **data mining** expertise
                and knowledge about **integrating backend services**
                with **intuitive user interfaces**
                (both in terms of graphical UIs and easy-to-use APIs).
            </AboutMeSectionParagraph>
            <AboutMeSectionParagraph>
                Additionally,
                I am constantly working on my **design** skills to
                create the aforementioned interfaces **NOT**
                make my users gouge their eyes out.
                So **in short**, I want to eventually be
                a **Full-stack developer** with
                some **UI/UX skills under my belt**.
