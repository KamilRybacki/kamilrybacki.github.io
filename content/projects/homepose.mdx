abstract: A homebrew library created to quickly set up my personal homelab using Docker and templated managed by a Python module. It also automatically advertises composed services using predefined domain and launches a custom DNS server, that can be used to resolve each service's address over local network.

This project was created **over the course of February and March**
during my deep dive into **dockerizing local services** to create my own **homelab**.
Due to the fact I am a 3D printing hobbyist,
I've wanted **a local Nextcloud storage** set up
to quickly share my STL files between a Raspberry Pi
(which is hooked up to my Ender 3 printer)
and any computer connected to home WiFi.

So, I've bought [a cheap Lenovo TinyPc](https://www.lenovo.com/hk/en/desktops-and-all-in-ones/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/0958/p/11TC1TMM72E0958),
plugged in a couple of 2.5 inch HDD I've has laying around
and that was the start of my **personal home server**.
After setting up NextCloud, I've decided to also
include **Gitea + Drone version control** to play around
with CI/CD workflows and backup code base
that was used solely over my local machines and
didn't really have place over GitHub.
Rest of the services used by me can be seen in the GitHub repo,
under the `stack/` directory.

To do all of this I've chosen Docker Compose as my container engine,
due to it's simplicity and an **abundace** of YAMLs posted all over the internet.
Also, any kind of cluster magic with K8s would be
a gross exaggeration of how my homelab should function
(due to its scale), at least for now.

You can read how the tools work in the Readme of this project,
since it's not just a simple Python script that calls `docker-compose up`
and wishes everybody a good day. It's a small scale library and
has some pre-building and post-setup hooks,
that may make Your everyday homelab admin life easier.
